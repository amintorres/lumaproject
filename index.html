{% capture about %}
The Luma Project will sit on 153 acres over a cliff that looks out into the Atlantic Ocean. The land will house an array of structures that will make up a technology center and will be surrounded by vast vegetation and stunning ocean views.

Each year, thousand of students and ten to fifteen startups will call the center home. The center will maintain a constant stream of instructors, guest speakers and mentors. Some of these will include staff, founders and CEOs of tech companies from the United States and South America.

To learn more about the center or to explore the possibility of becoming part of it, email us here. We are particularly interested in teaching, speaking and mentorship engagements. You do not have to speak Spanish.

If you work at Google, Facebook, or Twitter, and are from Latin America or of Latin American descent, please drop us a note. We would love to speak to you.

If you are in the Dominican Republic and want to be part of our first class, send us an email describing your project and the stage you are currently at with it.
